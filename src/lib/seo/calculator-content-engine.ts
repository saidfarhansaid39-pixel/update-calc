Even small adjustments to either parameter produce dramatically different outcomes. For example, a ${exampleVal2} unit difference in the principal or term can change your total cost by hundreds of dollars over the life of the calculation. This is because financial formulas use exponential or multiplicative relationships rather than simple addition. Understanding this sensitivity helps you prioritize which variables to negotiate or optimize. The most successful financial strategies focus on the inputs that have the largest multiplier effect on the final result.`, subsections: [{ heading: 'The Time Value of Money Applied', text: `Time is the most powerful variable in financial calculations.

A loan with a slightly higher rate but significantly lower fees may be cheaper overall. An investment with lower volatility but modest returns might outperform a high-risk alternative when adjusted for risk. The calculator provides this component breakdown automatically.`, subsections: [{ heading: 'Principal and Base Amounts', text: `The starting amount is the foundation of your calculation. A change of ${exampleVal1} units in the principal directly scales the final result. The calculator shows how much of the outcome comes from the base amount versus the growth or cost applied to it.` }, { heading: 'Recurring Contributions or Payments', text: `Regular additions or deductions compound alongside the base amount.
